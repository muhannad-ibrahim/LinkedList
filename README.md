# LinkedList
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

# Basic Operations on Linked List

    Traversal: To traverse all the nodes one after another.
    Insertion: To add a node at the given position.
    Deletion: To delete a node.
    Searching: To search an element(s) by value.
    Updating: To update a node.
    Sorting: To arrange nodes in a linked list in a specific order.
    Merging: To merge two linked lists into one.
